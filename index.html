                <div class="features-wrapper">
					<p>When it comes to astrology, what is the first few questions that come to our mind??<p/>
					<p>"Does this really work?”, <p/>
					<p>“Is it a science?”, <p/>
					<p>“How do these big bodies in the cosmos effect on us?”, <p/>
					<p>“Is it Gravity?" <p/>

					<p>A revered scientist Carl Sagan pointed out in his journal that the Physician in the room who delivers a baby from its mother has more gravitational influence than the planets. This does seem to be a bit true but when you evaluate the Mass and gravitational influence of the physician and compare it with Jupiter's Mass and
					gravitational influence, Jupiter's gravitation influence will still beat the physician's influence by more than 20 times. <p/>

					<p>So the answer to the big question, How does astrology really work? <p/>
					Well, it’s simple, I don't know. Infact, I don’t think anybody knows. <p/>

					<p>Well, before we talk about astrology and its abilities, We need to ask ourselves a few questions,<p/>
					<p>Do we know all the forces of Nature? <p/>
					<p>Do we know all forms of Energy? <p/>

					<p>What did we know about the Apple falling from the tree until Isaac Newton discovered that it was gravity? It took 2.4 million years to discover gravity. <p/>

					<p>Do you think a Doctor knows entirely how the body functions? <p/>
					<p>The answer is NO. A doctor does not know how the body functions completely.
					He uses his senses to perceive how the chemical reactions in the body function and depending on that makes a prognosis. It is repeatable on a diagnostic level and this is based on the thousands of years of research.<p/>

					<p>But the doctor does not know how the body functions more than an astrologer knows about astronomy. The doctor does not know how the heart works. He only knows where in the brain-stem the electrical impulse is sent. But where does the impulse originate? How does the impulse know exactly when to emanate? How does the body keep breathing? How do the cells know exactly what to do all the time? The pancreas secretes insulin at the right time, but how do the cells in the
					Pancreas knows when that time has arrived? What makes it all work? How does our food just digest itself? From where does this cosmic genius emanate?</p>

					<p>Just because the doctor or other scientists can perceive results and offer explanations about what and why, does not mean they know any more than astrologers do. </p>

					<p>We ask things of astrology we don’t ask of regular sciences, then discredit it because it not scientific.</p>

					<p>Let’s now compare the analysis process of a Doctor and that of an Astrologer.</p>

					<p>The diagnostic process that doctor performs is similar to what an astrologer does. The doctor takes the pulse and breathing and then the lab reports to analyse what the issue is and then prescribes treatment. </p>

					<p>Similarly an astrologer takes the birth chart and analyses what is happening with respect to the problems and then prescribes remedies. Like looking at a lab report of insulin amount in blood and urine, all the doctors say the same thing, similarly by looking at the chart if there is mars in first house all astrologers say the same thing. </p>

					<p>We might think that if that is the case then all the people born at the same time should have same kind of life, they could be either rich or poor, wise
					or idiots, healthy or disabled. </p>

					<p>Well this is where the Law of Karma comes into the picture.</p>

					<p>Astrology and Karma are both tightly bound, more on Karma in another article. People born at the same time and same place, may not necessarily have the same fate or destiny, one person might be born rich while the other may be poor, but the problems and difficulties they face in life relating to health ,career, marriage etc., to an extent will be similar.</p>

					<p>Rather than pondering on proofs and explanations about astrology, here is what one should do; they should try it out for themselves. </p>

					<p>This is exactly like when you ask for directions or look at the GPS.You cannot be sure that the direction that a person just gave or what the GPS is displaying is correct unless you follow them. Only when you reach, you know that it is right or wrong. </p>

					<p>Hence try it for yourselves and then see if it works or not. </p>

					<p>This is something you won't hear from a person who has studied and understood Astrology.</p>

					<p>"I have been studying astrology and looking into it. Nothing makes sense, it just doesn't work...!!"</p>

                <div class="features-wrapper">
					<p>Whenever we have a counselling session with an Astrologer, it gets exciting to know what our future holds for us.
					To begin with it is necessary to understand the limitations of Astrology and become clear on how to get most out of the session. </p>
					<p>We should understand some below mentioned facts before we visit an astrologer for consultation-</p>
					<p>• Astrologer cannot solve all your problems. The remedies suggested will work depending on the Magnitude of ones Karma.</p>
					<p>• Astrology should not be used for day to day decision making. It is a tool to help us in our problems, it should never become the deciding factor in every minute aspect of our life.</p>

					<p>So how should one gain effectively through Astrological guidance?
					Astrological guidance and inputs can help a person in various aspects of life, it can</p>
					<p>• Increase a general level of awareness of self and our surroundings.</p>
					<p>• It can provide valuable inputs to the current situations in life.</p>
					<p>• It can identify one's strengths and weaknesses which can be applied to ones advantage.</p>
					<p>• It can bring focus on available choices and can suggest an optimal course of action. 
						However a person should use discretion and take responsibility for either following or not following the advice.</p>
					<p>Before we take any consultations from an Astrologer, we should always verify the credibility of the astrologer by verifying the events that have happened in the past. 
					If an astrologer is able point out the correct events in the past and their timing, the predictions for future will be mostly correct. 
					This will also validate the chart details provided.</p>
					<p>Astrology is never 100% accurate and is only an approximation of the possible events.</p>
					<p>The future is always a resultant of our past actions, our current situation and how we react to our current situation. 
					No matter how our Karma unfolds there is always room for free will. </p>
					<p>It is up to us to give up or face the problems. Astrology can only provide guidance on how to face them.</p>
